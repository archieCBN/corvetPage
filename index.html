                The Chevrolet Corvette, known also as the Vette or Chevy Corvette, is a front engine, rear
            drive, two-door, two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet across more
            than sixty years of production and seven design generations. As Chevrolet's halo vehicle, the
            Corvette is widely noted for its performance and distinctive plastic — either fiberglass or
            composite — bodywork.

                In 1953, when GM executives were looking to a name the new Chevrolet sports car, assistant
            director for the Public Relations department Myron Scott suggested Corvette after the small
            maneuverable warship — and the name was approved. The first model, a convertible, was
            introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept and was followed ten years later, in the
            1963 second generation, in coupe and convertible styles. Originally manufactured in Flint,
            Michigan as well as St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 in
            Bowling Green, Kentucky.

                The Corvette has since become widely known as "America's Sports Car". Automotive News said that
            after 'starring' in the early 1960s television show Route 66, the Corvette became synonymous
            with freedom and adventure," ultimately becoming both "the most successful concept car in history
            and the most popular sports car in history.
